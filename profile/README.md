We are a team of two friends who like to create with code. We believe that **people learn the most by doing**, which is also one of the principles of scouting education. We are both computer geeks, we both love nature and we both like to help people learn new things.

We use a database full of publicly available data and a few clever algorithms to generate cities in Minecraft. Thanks to that, you can walk around real places and enjoy the game as it was intended, but in your neighbourhood.
